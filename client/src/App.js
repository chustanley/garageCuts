AuthContextProvider is a context that also acts like redux by providing all of its child access to its state

Routes is creating a bunch of route within your project, before this in our root we placed BrowserRouter there
for us to be able to use these react router dom.

We placed a Protected component that will return the child aka account if the user is present, and if not,
we return the home page. (check Protected File)
