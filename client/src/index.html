    <!-- Bundle.js file is the output file from running the webpack command.
         Webpack is a module bundler and it bundles together all the files into a single file output
         It will use Babel and transpile the code into browser readable code

         The reason why we need webpack to compile all these files w/ babel transpilation is because
         some Javascript code is not supported by all web browsers and transpiling allows you to write
         code using the latest language features (es6) while ensuring it can still be executed in a wide range of browsers

         Result: add it as a script tag and this will play as the SRC
        -->
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
